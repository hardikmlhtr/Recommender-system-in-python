Matrix Factorization technique for recommender system

The following simulations of recommender systems assumes non negative matrix factorization. 
Given input is the matrix in which ith row represent ratings of ith user and jth column represent 
jth item ( movie). Ratings are non-negative and assumed to be in range (1, 5). 0
represent a gap where the user has not rated the movie. Our aim is to fill this gap considering 
his ratings to the other movies and ratings to that movie by other users. 
Output matrix is X (= UVT  ) which represent the matrix approximately equal to given matrix as 
input with the gaps filled.
In this analysis I have started with two trivial cases, one in which each movie is rated same by 
each user and the other in which each user rates same every movie. Each case is followed with simulations 
with changing D (Dim (feature_vector) ) and effect of the change is observed and inferred after first case.
Last two cases show the simulations with a 5*5 matrix and some 5*10 matrix showing that the code is functional 
with a general m*n matrix.
